## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
My answer may be different after we cover wireframes tomorrow.   Basically I'm picture the one screen that will house the tic tac toe game.   There will be a link in the top right corner to register or to sign in if already registered.
-   The data structure you plan to use.
Arrays
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
pushing images/elements to an array that represents the board.
-   How you plan to approach this project.
Approach will be just like outlined in schedule.md.   Develop in very small segments.  Get the logic down and then add animation & even listeners towards the end.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
1. Register for the game by giving username, email, and creating password.  Possibly adding functionality to upload a photo or somehow let user tailor their profile.
2. Make instructions simple and easy to read for the users.
3. Ability to end game part way through.
4. Reset to start another game.
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
Separate smaller junks of code for separate functions.   Possibly even more than one js file.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
I believe the game is for two users.   Would like to make it so that one user could play against an automated player placing random X's or O's.
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
Absolutely.   "Commit early and often."
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
I hope to be in position to attempt the bonuses.

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
